# Welcome and Thank you for taking part!

### **Instructions:**
We will present you with numbers from 1 to 9, 5 excluded.
For each number, your task is to tell whether the number is odd or even or whether it is greater than 5 or less than 5.

Before each number appears, it will appear a rectangle at the top of the screen. The orientation of the rectangle will indicate which task you are to perform. 
You will see two examples in the next screens.

The rectangle and the number will be surrounded by a frame. You will notice that this frame will appear in different colours. Yet the frame and its colour are not informative for your task.

### **Tip:**
Please read the **2 following screens carefully** and try to memorize the information.
You can **note them down** on a piece of paper if you want. However, you will
be able to read these instructions as much as you want, before the real experiment starts!
