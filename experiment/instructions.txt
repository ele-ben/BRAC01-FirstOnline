# Welcome and Thank you for taking part!

### **Instructions:**
We will display digits on the screen from 1 to 9, 5 excluded.
For each number, your task is to tell whether the number is odd or even or whether it is greater than 5 or less than 5.

Before each number appears, it will appear a rectangle at the top of the screen. The orientation of the rectangle will indicate which task you are to perform. 
You will see two examples in the next screens.

The rectangle and the number will be surrounded by a frame. Also, you will notice that notice that the rectangle may appear in different colours. Yet, the frame and the rectangle colours are not informative for your task.

### **Tip:**
Please read the **2 following screens carefully** and try to memorize the information.
Don't worry! You'll be able to read these instructions as much as you want and there will be a training phase before the real experiment starts!

## Please try to answer as **fast** as possible, but also to be as **accurate** as possible. 

## In order to increase your speed, please keep your index fingers on the A and L keys through all the duration of the experiment.

## You will first start with a short training (30 seconds or less), to familiarize with the task. You must complete this training at least once.

## In the lower part of the screen, you will see an image that reminds you the meaning of the rectangle and of the A and L keys. Naturally, you're free to look at it, particularly in the training. However, in order to **achieve the required speed**, you ought to **memorize the information**, so that you can answer as soon as the digit appears on the screen.
