IMPORTANT: it is necessary to download funx_10.py file from my functions-experiments repository
For simplicity, put it in the same folder of Draw_tasks_4.py file.

Here we build .csv files containing the information necessary to describe the
sequence of trials and breaks of an experiment. Specifically, the main script
generates 16 spreadsheets for experiment 1 and 16 for experiment 2, each representing
a different counterbalance condition and having differen pseudorandom trials
sequence in it.

The experiment folder contains:

expBuilding.py: main script to build spreadsheets that describe a full experiment
Draw_tasks_4.py: collects functions called by the main script
instructions.txt: file with some text for the instructions to paste in Gorilla
spreadsheetNmes.txt: a list of the spreadsheets names for conveniency
/spreadsheets: contains the spreadsheets generated by the main script
/img: contains images generated by the main script, stimuli, mappings guide
