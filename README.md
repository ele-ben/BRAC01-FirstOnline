# BRAC01-FirstOnline
Online Task switching cognitive psychology experiment with visual stimuli and keyboard responses.
.csv files and images are generated to be uploaded in Gorilla.

IMPORTANT: it is necessary to download funx_10.py file from my functions-experiments repository
For simplicity, put it in the same folder of Draw_tasks_4.py file.

Here we build .csv files containing the information necessary to describe the
sequence of trials and breaks of an experiment. Specifically, the main script
generates 16 spreadsheets for experiment 1 and 16 for experiment 2, each representing
a different counterbalance condition and having differen pseudorandom trials
sequence in it.

The experiment folder contains:

expBuilding.py: main script to build spreadsheets that describe a full experiment
Draw_tasks_4.py: collects functions called by the main script
instructions.txt: file with some text for the instructions to paste in Gorilla
spreadsheetNmes.txt: a list of the spreadsheets names for conveniency
/spreadsheets: contains the spreadsheets generated by the main script
/img: contains images generated by the main script, stimuli, mappings guide

### Interpret spreadsheets names
Spreadsheets names are assigned so that they tell the exp (e.g. BRAC1), the
key-response mapping and the cue-task mapping (e.g. vertAA) and the cocoa (e.g.
1st300). The cue-task mapping is referred to the magnitude task, and the parity
mapping follows suit. In "BRAC1_vertAA_1st300", magnitude task is mapped to the
vertical cue and, consequently, parity to the horizontal. The key-response mapping
lists first the key for the "great" response (the "less" follows suit) and then
the key for the "odd" response (the "even", follows suit). In this example, great
is mapped to A and less to L and odd to A and even to L. "1st300" stands for blocks
with odd number (1st, 3rd, 5th... blocks) have cocoa 300 and blocks with even
number have cocoa 0.
