Hi everybody!
Long post, sorry for this, but I tried to be thorough :)
I have a question on how to assess the incremental impact of adding trials on reaction times estimations.
My main research focus is cognitive psychology and we mostly use reaction times as dependent variable. The common practice for running our experiments is to have (poor!) participants complete 8 to 10 blocks, each made of 40-100 trials. Beacuse of coronavirus outbreak, we tried to move our experiments online and there, it is higly recommended to shorten experiments up. The questions then are:
How bad is it for the accuracy of my estimates to have half of the data points I usually have? and
How can I assess it?" 

What I tried, is to take data from a lab experiment of mine, in which I had 8 blocks and N possible experimental conditions. Then, for each of my 33 participants and each condition (16), I took trials from blocks 1 and 2 and trials from blocks 1, 2, 3, 4 and I ran a Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov Test, to test the null hypothesis that reaction times in blocks 1 and 2 were extracted from a different distribution with respect to reaction times in blocks 1 to 4. Then I did the same test, this time comparing trials in blocks 1 to 4 with trials in blocks 1 to 6 (yes, I ran 24*16*4 tests). Then I did the same comparing trials in blocks 1 to 6 to trials in the whole experiment, that is blocks 1 to 8. This way I was hoping to test the incremental effect of having 2 more blocks of trials on rts distribution. In my opinion, if I was able to reject the null hypothesis that, for example, distribution of rts in 6 blocks is different from distribution of rts in 8 blocks, I would have shown that the "true" rts distribution of that person in that experimental condition it is not correctly detected with 6 blocks only...
Is this correct in itself? Is this a sensible way to address my problem? How would you approach this problem otherwise? 
Many thanks in adavance!
